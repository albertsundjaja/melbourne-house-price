## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

The purpose of this project is to answer several questions regarding Melbourne's housing market during the COVID19 pandemic. We will be using the 2016 - 2018 Melbourne House Price dataset and a recently collected 2020 House Price dataset

1. Does price go down during COVID19?
1. Is the price of most expensive suburbs affected?
3. What factors are important in determining property price? How does the pandemic affect this?
